# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** to build a machine learning pipeline that identifies fraudulent transactions. The goal is to explore both **unsupervised anomaly detection** and **supervised classification** methods on a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Description: Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
- Total transactions: 284,807
- Fraudulent transactions: 492 (0.17%)

Due to GitHub file size limits, the full dataset is not uploaded here. Please download it directly from Kaggle and place it in the root folder as `creditcard.csv`.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Processing & EDA
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked class imbalance and missing values
- Visualized transaction distributions

### 2. ⚠️ Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM

### 3. Supervised Learning
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

### 5. Visualization
- Correlation heatmaps
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Model performance plots
